# Basic Search Engine #3
* This time, the previous task is modified by adding sorting algorithms.
* In addition to the Binary Search Tree and Hash Table, this time applied different sort algorithms on separate
vectors (Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Insertion Sort) and applied a binary search on the sorted
vectors in order to find the input words.
* Compared the time taken by using BST, Hash Table, binary search, and different sort algorithms.
